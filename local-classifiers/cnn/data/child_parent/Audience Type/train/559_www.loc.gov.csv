We will only disclose personal information to contractors or associates to carry out your requests; these third parties follow our privacy policy or prominently display their own.

"14"," Children's Privacy Policy    Children are naturally curious about our world and the Library considers it part of its mission to reach out to them in creative and educational ways that protect their privacy. Certain Library websites offer educational content to children under 13 and this privacy policy, which complies with COPPA (the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), will be available at these sites by a link.  ","Children","International and Specific Audiences"
"15","Some of these sites provide games and activities, and occasionally, we collect personally identifiable information in order to complete the one-time game or activity. We do not use the information for any other purpose and delete the information as soon as practical. For example, in our Lifelong Literacy area, children can create an online picture postcard and email it to a friend. In order to send the online postcard, we need both email addresses as well as the child's first name so that the recipient will know who sent the card. This information is not retained. If the child chooses to post the online postcard in our gallery, we will not post any personally identifying information.  ","Children","International and Specific Audiences"
"16","If we become aware that a child under the age of 13 has made a request for information, for example through our Ask a Librarian forms, we will respond to the request and any identifying information will be deleted once we have responded. Similarly, if we become aware that a child under 13 posted personally identifiable information on any of our websites, we will also delete that information.  ","Children","International and Specific Audiences"
"17","The Library will disclose information about a child under the age of 13 if it is necessary to protect the child or the site itself, or to respond to law enforcement.  ","Children","International and Specific Audiences"
"18","We take children's privacy very seriously, and encourage parents to contact us with any questions or concerns they may have via the web form at www.loc.gov/contact/web-site-comments/. Additionally, if parents want us to delete any collected personally identifiable information about their children under the age of 13, they can also contact us at the website address listed above.
