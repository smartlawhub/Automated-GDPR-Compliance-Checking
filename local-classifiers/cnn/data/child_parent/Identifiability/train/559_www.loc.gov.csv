"15","Some of these sites provide games and activities, and occasionally, we collect personally identifiable information in order to complete the one-time game or activity. We do not use the information for any other purpose and delete the information as soon as practical. For example, in our Lifelong Literacy area, children can create an online picture postcard and email it to a friend. In order to send the online postcard, we need both email addresses as well as the child's first name so that the recipient will know who sent the card. This information is not retained. If the child chooses to post the online postcard in our gallery, we will not post any personally identifying information.  ","Aggregated or anonymized","First Party Collection/Use"
"20"," About Our Web Surveys    The Library uses various types of online forms and surveys to collect opinions and feedback from a random sample of visitors.

The Library may also use other third party forms and surveys allowing you to provide feedback. All information you submit is voluntary.  ","Aggregated or anonymized","Third Party Sharing/Collection"
