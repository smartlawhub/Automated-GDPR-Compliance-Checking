"13","Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)   We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.

The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
