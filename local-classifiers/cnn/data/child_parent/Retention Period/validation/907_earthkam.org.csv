"9","Sally Ride Science has taken steps to ensure that any information we collect is secure. Our security measures include limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database and servers, utilizing electronic security systems, and using password protections that guard against unauthorized access. We are also sensitive to security concerns regarding the use of credit cards for purchases. We protect your credit card information (and all other personal information) using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology that automatically encrypts all data while information is being transmitted over the Internet. Furthermore, we will not keep your credit card number in our database once a transaction is completed.  ","Limited","Data Retention"
