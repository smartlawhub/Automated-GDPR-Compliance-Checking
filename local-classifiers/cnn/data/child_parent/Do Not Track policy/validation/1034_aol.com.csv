"27","""Do Not Track"" Signals   Some web browsers may transmit ""do not track"" signals to the websites and other online services with which the browser communicates. There is no standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals. AOL currently does not take action in response to these signals. If and when a standard for responding is established, we may revisit its policy on responding to these signals.  ","Not honored","Do Not Track"
