"28","How we respond to Do Not Track Disclosures .   Some browsers have a do not track feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Because these features are not yet uniform, we are not currently set up to respond to do not track signals. Our information and disclosure practices will continue to apply as described in this privacy policy regardless of any Do Not Track signals that are sent by certain browsers.  ","Not honored"
