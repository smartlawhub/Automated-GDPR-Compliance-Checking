"72","17. GIFT CERTIFICATES AND PLAYLISTS   If you choose to send a gift certificate or playlist to an individual, we will ask you for the individuals name and email address. We will automatically send a one-time email to the individual either with notice of their gift certificate along with an activation key or an invitation to visit the Websites. The recipient will be asked to create a user name and password to activate their subscription, and during this process, they will also be asked if they want to receive any newsletters or other emails from lynda.com. lynda.com stores name and email address of the recipient for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. The individual may contact us at support@lynda.com to request that we remove this information from our database.  ","Collect on website"
