"3","  Comment Service and Account Information In order to further enhance the user experience, Kinja allows users to comment on some or all of Kinja sites, enabling users to discuss and contribute to topics posted to those sites. Users have the option of signing up for this service, and to do so must either submit some valid information or set up an anonymous account. Kinja uses this information to screen out users who leave comments prohibited by our Terms of Use, to make notifications to users when necessary, to pick out topics of interest to commenters, and in certain circumstances to create a Kinja ""page"" for each such user where such user's contributions are collected. You may link your account to certain Third Party Services and to do so, may be required to provide your login information for those services. If you login via a Third Party Service, we will receive an identifying token from that service, which will allow us to access some information from your account on that service, so that we can, for example, send you a message through that service. Kinja does not receive or store passwords from your Third Party Service and will not pass information provided when you register via a Third Party Service to any other organization except in aggregate form.
