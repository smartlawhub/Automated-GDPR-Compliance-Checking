"52"," Email.    We share our users' email addresses with service providers that send email messages and deliver targeted advertising in our emails on our behalf. These service providers may collect data about how you interact with those messages (including information about whether and when you opened a particular message or clicked on a link within a message and the device you used to do so) and analyze it in conjunction with similar information they collect when you respond to emails they send on behalf of their other clients who are not affiliated with us. They use this email response information in combination with your email address to target and optimize the delivery of emails and email advertising they send on our behalf and for their other clients. We may also provide our service providers with lists of our user email addresses that they use in a hash-encrypted form to recognize our users when they subscribe to third-party email services and send them interest-based advertising on those services. We do not authorize our email service providers to share your email address with their other clients.  ","Secure data storage"
