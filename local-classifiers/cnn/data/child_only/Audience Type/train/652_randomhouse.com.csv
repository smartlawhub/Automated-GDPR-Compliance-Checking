"13"," California Do Not Track Notice    Some browsers offer a ""Do Not Track"" feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. We do not respond to these ""Do Not Track"" signals. At this time, we do not track your personal information about your online activities over time and across third party websites. We also do not authorize third parties to collect any personal information from you on the Sites for these purposes.  ","Californians"
"27"," Children's Privacy Policy    PRH respects the privacy of children and we are committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). This Children's Privacy Policy describes our practices with respect to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13. This Site does not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information from children under the age of 13 without prior parental consent, except as permitted by COPPA.  ","Children"
"28"," What Information We Collect and How We Use It    We do not require children to share any personal information in order to participate on this Site. On occasion, however, we may collect personal information, such as an email address from a child as part of an activity, in accordance with COPPA. For example:  ","Children"
"29","Email address: We may collect a child's email address in order to respond to a one-time request from the child, such as if the child asks us or one of our authors a question. In such case, we promptly delete the child's email address from our system once we have responded, and we do not use the child's email address for any other purpose.  ","Children"
"30","Send-a-friend: In the case of send-a-friend email or card, we only collect a child's first name and the friend's email address to send the friend the email or card. We do not store the friend's email address for any longer than reasonably necessary to send the email or card to the friend.  ","Children"
"31","Email newsletters: We may collect a child's email address if the child wishes to sign up for our email newsletters. In such instance, the child will be asked to provide his or her email address and the email address of his or her parent/guardian. We will send the child's parent/guardian a notification email informing them of the child's request to receive the newsletter by email on an ongoing basis and give the parent/guardian the option to have his or her child's information removed from our newsletter database. If the newsletter is declined, we will not send the newsletter and will delete any related personal information collected in the sign-up process from our files. If the newsletter is not declined, we will send the newsletter. All newsletters contain instructions so that the recipient may unsubscribe at any time.  ","Children"
"32","Contests or Sweepstakes: We may collect a child's email address to enter the child in a sweepstakes or contest or to notify the child that he or she has won or lost a contest or sweepstakes or contest. We will not keep the child's email address after the promotion or use the child's email address for any other purpose other than for the promotion. For certain promotions, we may ask that a child give us his/her parent's email address so we can obtain more personalized information for prize fulfillment purposes if the child wins the promotion or to notify the parent if we need more than the child's email address to enter the child in the promotion. In the latter event, parents will be sent a notice along with instructions on how they may provide their consent for their child to participate in such promotion.  ","Children"
"33","We may also collect anonymous information automatically from your child's computer or device, such as the frequency with which the child visits our Site and the pages visited, to support the internal operations of the Site. We collect this information so we can understand and monitor usage of the Site, customize content on the Site and improve the performance of the Site.
