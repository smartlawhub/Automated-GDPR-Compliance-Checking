"23"," Children's privacy    We do allow children under 13 to register for an account, but we do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13. Personally identifiable information, for example, includes a first and last name; a home or other physical address; an e-mail address; a telephone number; or a social security number.  ","Children"
"24","When we have identified through our age-screening process that a child under 13 is trying to register an account with us, we immediately ""hash"" that user's e-mail into a nonreversible character string and discard the e-mail. Then the user's e-mail address is only used for ""password recovery"" purposes.  ","Children"
"25","Generally speaking, one-way hashing is a way to anonymize or hide data by transforming pieces of information into fixed strings of alphanumeric characters.  ","Children"
"26","For example, when the e-mail address 'U13user@dictionary.com' is hashed, the result or ""hash value"" might be 'a8der13ap69'. Every time that hash function is applied to that e-mail address the result will be the same. It is called one-way hashing because the function allows you to convert the data only one way. So while it is possible to convert an e-mail address into a hash value, it is not possible to convert that value back into the e-mail address.  ","Children"
"27","When a child under the age of 13 registers for an account, we use hashing to create a password reminder system that does not require us to retain that child's email address. To do this, we apply the hash function to the email address and associate the resulting hash value (not the e-mail) with the user's account. The e-mail address is immediately discarded after the hash function is applied.  ","Children"
"29"," Information from users outside the United States    If you're outside the United States, your information will be sent to and stored in the United States, where our servers are located. By using our sites and apps, you agree to the information collection, use, and sharing practices described in this Privacy Policy.  ","Citizens from other countries"
"30"," YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS (as provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83)    A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (""California customer"") is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed.  ","Californians"
"31","However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its Privacy Policy) a policy of not disclosing customer's personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure or gives customers a mechanism to opt out of having their personal information disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise the right.
